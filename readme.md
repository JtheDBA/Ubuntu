# My Ubuntu Crap

Hi there.

If you found this by accident: this is a complete (incomplete?) work in progress from some aging nerd with aging technology (that is still good for some things) in his basement attempting to stay current with some things while providing services for one additional human being and three cats in our meager four level dwelling in the Midwest United States. I'm also 1) curious what you were searching for or how you found this and 2) welcome, hope you find something useful.

If you were given this repository by me, hi there. Hopefully you find something here that is usable and might save you time and frustration. Feel free to contribute, laugh at me, buy me a beer or six or just nerd up with me.

In both cases, I'm in the process of moving years of text files containing scripts, instructions, scribbles, various notes, frustrations, successes and other goodies from Dropbox to GitHub (probably to move somewhere else soon).

Also note, I am well aware of solutions like Vagrant and Docker.

# Crap That's Here

There is crap for home users and crap for professional uses i.e. small businesses, etc. I am likely not qualified to comment on large Enterprise crap as a basement hobbyist; but I may try or pretend to be.

## Common Crap

Common crap is crap that both home and professional users could potentially benefit from including:

*  [centralized apt package cache](common/apt-cacher-ng.md) apt-cacher-ng - download packages once instead of for each existing or new installation
*  centralized location for software and .iso images - see above
*  centralized location for basic installation and operational scripts - need something? go here
*  a common database; I chose MariaDB

# Servers

-  Home Server
-  Administrative Servers

# Desktops

Simple desktop crap. Including how to quickly create a [VirtualBox VM for anything you have an .iso image for](../desktop/Ubuntu Desktops in VirtualBox.md).

# VirtualBox Labs

# Neat Projects

# Resources
Most of the contents in this repository come from pieces parts from the Internet and trial and failure in virtual machines from version 14.04 and beyond. While I am certain I have missed numerous resources that I do apologize for that here's a list of current and active links that I know of that were helpful.
