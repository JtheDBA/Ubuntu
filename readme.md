# My Ubuntu Crap

Hi there.

If you found this by accident: this is a complete work in progress from some aging nerd with aging technology in his basement that is still good for some things attempting to stay current with some things while providing services for one additional human being and three cats in our meager four level dwelling in the Midwest United States.

If you were given this repository by me, hi there. Hopefully you find something here that is usable and might save you time and frustration. Feel free to contribute, laugh at me, buy me a beer or six or just nerd up with me.

In both cases, I'm in the process of moving years of text files containing scripts, instructions, scribbles, various notes, frustrations, successes and other goodies from Dropbox to GitHug (probably to move somewhere else soon).

# Crap That's Here

# Types of Crap

## Control Scripts

## Administrative Servers

A centralized administrative server (or servers) is essential to any multi-computer virtual or physical system. The central server would have at least the following:

* centralized apt package location (apt-cacher-ng)
* centralized location for software and .iso images
* centralized location for basic installation and operational scripts

In addition to the above most professional implementations would have centralized servers for large-scale operations and management and orchestration of numerous resources. I may try to fart around with this in the future so most of this is a to do list:

* puppet
* chef
* ansible
* juju

## Desktops


## Servers

## BASE

## Home Server

* centralized apt package location (apt-cacher-ng), software and .iso images, basic installation and operational scripts and storage


# Resources
Most of the contents in this repository come from pieces parts from the Internet and trailing failure in virtual machines from version 14.04 and beyond. While I am certain I have missed numerous resources that I do apologize for that here's a list of current and active links that I know of that were helpful.
