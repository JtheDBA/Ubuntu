Note: I am deferring all work to other projects like Thomas Sjögren's aka konstruktoid's [hardening](https://github.com/konstruktoid/hardening) repository for 20.04 and beyond.

Alsø Nøte: I am well aware of the arguments for and against how "hard" to make your "Ubuntu" and will try to balance soft, semi-hard and fully hard versions and test as much as I can within the scope of drinking beer and goofing around in my basement.

## Goal

The goal of this document is to create a secure installation of Ubuntu Server. This is an attempt to combine numerous online resources into something that is both reasonable and implementable in a small to midsize virtualized environment.

# Securing the System Part Two - Attack of the Cloned (Advice)

# Securing the System Part Three - Revenge of the Sith (em Administrators)

# Securing the System Part Four - A New Hope

This section does not have anything in it yet; I was just keeping with the Star Wars movie theme...

# Securing the System Part Five - The Ubuntu Strikes Back

# Securing the System Part Six - Return of the Juju

This section is more for the future. Most large organizations use Chef, Puppet, Ansible, etc. to provision servers or containers and they either come with pre-built recipies/scripts for secure distributions or most people create them.
