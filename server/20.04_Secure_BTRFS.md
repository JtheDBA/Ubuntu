# Secure Ubuntu Server 20.04 BTRFS

The Ubuntu 20.04 does not create a subvolume for the root mount point and just stuffs everything in the default subvolume (ID=5)

So this renders all previous work with BTRFS and mounted subvolumes for backup and recovery a pain in the ass.

So I will concentrate on the LVM secured system based.
