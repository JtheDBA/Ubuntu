-  **secure.server1 i.e. Part Two; confirmed as working in VirtualBox BIOS and EFI and physical machine EFI - 01/26/2020 11:42:57 AM**

Note: I found Thomas Sjögren's aka konstruktoid's [hardening](https://github.com/konstruktoid/hardening) repository maybe a month after first starting the revamp of the originally based on LVM document I did for 16.04 and 14.04. It appears Thomas is way more advanced than I and if you need a serious solution maybe go there first?

Alsø Nøte: I am well aware of the arguments for and against how "hard" to make your "Ubuntu" and will try to balance soft, semi-hard and fully hard versions and test as much as I can within the scope of drinking beer and goofing around in my basement.

A Møøse once bit my sister...

## Goal

The goal of this document is to create a secure installation of Ubuntu Server. This is an attempt to combine numerous online resources into something that is both reasonable and implementable in a small to midsize virtualized environment.

This also assumes you have come here from either [BTRFS](Ubuntu Server 18.04 BTRFS Secure.md) or [LVM](readme.md) starting points.

# Securing the System Part Two - Attack of the Cloned (Advice)

This next session attempts to combine all of the items the experts agree upon into something that can be implemented in Server 18.04.

## Update System and Packages

First, if you already have apt-cacher-ng setup point apt there.

Installed
-  The `deborphan` technically is not needed anymore but Ubuntu does not do a complete job of keeping itself clean so install it.
-  Both `apparmor-profiles` and `apparmor-utils` are recommended by the UK
-  `auditd`
-  Goodies like cifs-utils libcups2 lynx mc nfs-common p7zip-full p7zip-rar rar samba-common unzip zip tree

Removed
-   The `popularity-contest` package sets up a cron job that will periodically anonymously submit to the Ubuntu developers statistics about the most used Ubuntu packages on this system. *This information helps us making decisions such as which packages should go on the first CD. It also lets us improve future versions of Ubuntu so that the most popular packages are the ones which are installed automatically for new users.* Pass...
-   The `unattended-upgrades` package can be used to automatically install updated packages, and can be configured to update all packages or just install security updates. *This is a personal choice; it causes more problems than it solves? Most people have well thought out update systems and processes?*

```Bash
apt update
apt -y full-upgrade
apt install -y apparmor-profiles apparmor-utils auditd deborphan cifs-utils libcups2 lynx mc nfs-common p7zip-full p7zip-rar rar samba-common unzip zip tree
apt remove -y popularity-contest unattended-upgrades
```

## /etc

Combination of all the "expertise" for securing files in the /etc directory.

```Bash
sed -i -e '/motd=/ s/session/#session/' /etc/pam.d/login
echo -e "Configuring home directories and shell access..."
sed -i -e '/^DIR_MODE=/ s/=[0-9]*\+/=0700/' /etc/adduser.conf
sed -i -e '/^UMASK\s\+/ s/022/077/' /etc/login.defs
echo -e "Disable shell access for new users (not affecting the existing admin user)."
sed -i -e '/^SHELL=/ s/=.*\+/=\/usr\/sbin\/nologin/' /etc/default/useradd
sed -i -e '/^DSHELL=/ s/=.*\+/=\/usr\/sbin\/nologin/' /etc/adduser.conf
sed -i -e '/pam_motd.so/s/session/#session/' /etc/pam.d/sshd
sed -i -e 's/#Banner none/Banner \/etc\/issue.net/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
cat > /etc/issue.net << FOOD

## AppArmor

Ah, yes. AppArmor. The part of Linux everyone recommends disabling so their crap works and the part everyone blames when things do not work. Personally, I have not found any issues yet. Please update this if you do.

I started with a combination of multiple sources then referenced the [Ubuntu Server Guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/apparmor.html)

*Everything here seems more than reasonable although there should be recommendations for logging enforced rules and nagging performed by AppArmor?*

```Bash
aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.avahi-daemon
aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.dnsmasq
aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/bin.ping
aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.rsyslogd
```

## auditd

Use [auditd](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man8/auditd.8.html) to monitor changes and executions within `/tmp` and administrator access to `/home` directories.

```Bash
cat > /etc/audit/rules.d/tmp-monitor.rules << FOOD
-w /tmp/ -p wa -k tmp_write
-w /tmp/ -p x -k tmp_exec
FOOD
cat  > /etc/audit/rules.d/admin-home-watch.rules << FOOD
-a always,exit -F dir=/home/ -F uid=0 -C auid!=obj_uid -k admin_home_user
FOOD
augenrules
systemctl restart auditd.service
```

## Privacy

>>By default Ubuntu has some features enabled which can be a privacy concern. To disable these features take the following steps:

```Bash
echo "Disable Apport error reporting service"
systemctl stop apport.service
systemctl disable apport.service
systemctl mask apport.service
sed -i -e '/^enabled=1$/ s/1/0/' /etc/default/apport
echo "Remove Popularity Contest service (removed above)"
```

## UFW Firewall

Evaluate the allow for OpenSSH to suit your environment.

```
ufw status verbose
ufw allow from 127.0.0.1
ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/24 to any app OpenSSH
ufw deny from any to any app OpenSSH
ufw logging on
ufw enable
```

# Securing the System Part Three - Revenge of the Sith (em Administrators)

This section is a collection of next steps that appear in some hardening guides, may or may not be useful depending on your situation, or may not be current (i.e. recommended with 16.04 but not 18.04), etc.

-  `sudo apt install -y fail2ban` 
-  `sudo apt install -y rkhunter` 50.4 MB - **Installer asks for a mail integration**
-  `dpkg-statoverride --update --add root adm 4750 /bin/su` - prevent standard user executing su (switch user) 

## Fail2Ban

Fail2Ban monitors log files for patterns similar to various attacks and runs scripts (usually blocking the source IP address) in response.

## Rootkit Hunter

Rootkit Hunter is a security monitoring and analyzing tool for POSIX compliant systems.

# Securing the System Part Four - A New Hope

This section does not have anything in it yet; I was just keeping with the Star Wars movie theme...

# Securing the System Part Five - The Ubuntu Strikes Back

This section revists some common items I have seen over the years that I am not qualified to address but will list here with my comments.

## Secure shared memory

*Shared memory can be used in an attack against a running service, so it is always best to secure that portion of memory. You can do this by modifying the `/etc/fstab` file.*

```Bash
sudo vi /etc/fstab
tmpfs /run/shm tmpfs defaults,noexec,nosuid 0 0
:x
sudo shutdown -r 1; exit
```

I do not know enough about shared memory to make a qualified response to this information but what goes through my head is since this security recommendation has been around since 14.04 and newer Ubuntu systems are being designed to not be
monolithic servers to run a collection of applications but instead run either operating system or application containers is securing shared memory still an issue? Or has it been addressed by modern updates to the various system components
or is part of the container systems being used and what role does `snap` play in all of this?

## Harden the networking layer

*There is a very simple way to prevent source routing of incoming packets*

```Bash
sudo -i
cat > /etc/sysctl.conf << FOOD
# IP Spoofing protection
​net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1
​net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1
​
​# Ignore ICMP broadcast requests
​net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1
​
​# Disable source packet routing
​net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
​net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0 
​net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
​net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
​
​# Ignore send redirects
​net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
​net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0
​
​# Block SYN attacks
​net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
​net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 2048
​net.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries = 2
​net.ipv4.tcp_syn_retries = 5
​
​# Log Martians
​net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1
​net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1
​
​# Ignore ICMP redirects
​net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
​net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
​net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0 
​net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0
​
​# Ignore Directed pings
​net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1
FOOD
sysctl -p.
```

From the `/etc/sysctl.conf` comments: *Additional settings - these settings can improve the network security of the host and prevent against some network attacks including spoofing attacks and man in the middle attacks through redirection. Some network environments, however, require that these settings are disabled so review and enable them as needed.*

## Prevent IP spoofing

*This one is quite simple and will go a long way to prevent your server's IP from being spoofed.*

```Bash
sudo -i
cat > /etc/host.conf << FOOD
# The "order" line is only used by old versions of the C library.
​order bind,hosts
​nospoof on
FOOD
```

# Securing the System Part Six - Return of the Juju

This section is more for the future. Most large organizations use Chef, Puppet, Ansible, etc. to provision servers or containers and they either come with pre-built recipies/scripts for secure distributions or most people create them.
